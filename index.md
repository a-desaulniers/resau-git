## 🎋 Introduction

Hi there!

My name is Alexandre, and I am a third year Electrical Engineering student at [Dalhousie University 🐯](https://www.dal.ca/). 

![[PXL_20230809_155103802~3.jpg]]

On this site, I hope to publish notes about projects that I am currently interested in, or that I am working on. This includes guides, UNIX, Programming, the outdoors, and Mathematics. My main site, [cabot.place](https://cabot.place/) doesn't, and I imagine never will, have much on it. It's got a funny spinning triangle. 

You can read more into my portfolio under [[About Me!  —  Alexandre DesAulniers|about me!]]

This site is being run on my Dell PowerEdge R715 homelab server, being routed through NGINX, and Cloudflare to the open web.  This web base is written entirely in `Markdown`, being interpreted by [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) into HTML. 

## 🖨️ Some of my Current Projects:

- [🗃️ Dell PowerEdge R715 Restoration | Homelab Project](poweredge.md)
	- VSphere, XCP-NG and finally, Proxmox
	- Proxmox Services Tree
	- [[imessage|🍎 MacOS Monterey Installation, with working IServices and Hardware Acceleration, on a Dual AMD Opteron 6380 server.]]
<br>
- Class notes, for those who struggle... (like I did)
