### **7. Depreciation and Taxes**

- **Objective:** Incorporate tax effects into cash flows.
- **Important to know all types of depreciation** 
- **Example Steps to Solve:**
    1. Use depreciation schedules (e.g., straight-line, declining balance).
    2. Calculate CCA, Straight Line, or whichever method you'd like to use: 
    $$
	    CCA=UCC×\text{Depreciation Rate}
	$$
$$
\text{Straight Line Annual Depreciation}=\frac{\text{Initial Cost}−\text{Salvage Value}}{\text{Useful Life}}
$$
 *Where UCC is the undepreciated capital cost.*
     
3. Adjust cash flows for tax savings (taxable income minus CCA).

<span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)"><span style="background:rgba(163, 67, 31, 0.2)"> ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ </span></span>
### **Straight Line Depreciation Example Problem**

**Problem:**  
A $50,000 machine depreciates over 5 years using the straight-line method. What is the annual depreciation expense?

**Formula:**
$$
\text{Annual Depreciation} = \frac{\text{Cost} - \text{Salvage Value}}{\text{Useful Life}}
$$

**Solution:**
$$
\text{Annual Depreciation} = \frac{50,000 - 0}{5}
$$

**Depreciation and Taxes (CCA Problem) Example Problem**

<span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)"><span style="background:rgba(163, 67, 31, 0.2)"> ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ </span></span>
### **CCA Depreciation Problem**

**Problem:**
A company purchases a piece of equipment for $100,000. The equipment belongs to Class 8, which has a Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) rate of 20%. What is the CCA deduction for the first year and the undepreciated capital cost (UCC) at the end of the first year? What about the second year?

### **Solution:**

1. **Determine the Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) for the First Year:**

   The formula to calculate the CCA for the first year only is:

   $$
   \text{CCA} = \text{UCC at the beginning of the year} \times \frac{1}{2}\text{CCA rate}
   $$
   For each following years, you can depreciate at the full CCA rate

   For the first year, the **UCC** is simply the purchase price of the equipment:

   $$
   \text{UCC}_0 = 100,000
   $$

   The **CCA rate** for Class 8 is 20%, or 0.20.

   Therefore, the CCA for the first year is:

   $$
   \text{CCA}_1 = 100,000 \times \frac{1}{2}0.20 = 10,000
   $$

2. **Calculate the Undepreciated Capital Cost (UCC) at the End of the First Year:**

   The **UCC** at the end of the year is calculated as:

   $$
   \text{UCC}_1 = \text{UCC}_0 - \text{CCA}_1
   $$

   $$
   \text{UCC}_1 = 100,000 - 10,000 = 90,000
   $$

### **Answer:**
- **CCA for the first year**: $10,000
- **CCA for the second year**: $18,000
- **Undepreciated Capital Cost (UCC) at the end of the first year**: $90,000
- **Undepreciated Capital Cost (UCC) at the end of the second year**: $72,000

### **8. Inflation and Risk Analysis**

- **Objective:** Adjust for inflation and assess project sensitivity.
- **Steps to Solve:**
    1. Calculate real and nominal cash flows considering inflation rate ($f$): 
    $$
    Real\space Cash\space Flow =\frac{Nominal\space Cash\space Flow}{(1+f)^n}
    $$
    3. Perform sensitivity analysis by varying key parameters (interest rate, costs).
    4. Determine risk measures (e.g., standard deviation, expected value, standard stats stuff).

<span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)"><span style="background:rgba(163, 67, 31, 0.2)"> ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ </span></span>
### **Basic Inflation Problem**

**Problem:**  
If the nominal cash flow is $1,000, and the inflation rate is 3%, what is the real cash flow after 2 years?

**Formula:**
$$
\text{Real Cash Flow} = \frac{\text{Nominal Cash Flow}}{(1 + f)^n}
$$

**Solution:**
$$
\text{Real Cash Flow} = \frac{1,000}{(1 + 0.03)^2}
$$

### **Risk Analysis with Probabilities Problem**

**Problem:**
A company is evaluating two investment projects, Project A and Project B, each with different probabilities of success. The company is considering the expected net present value (NPV) of each project, where the probabilities of success and failure, along with associated cash flows, are as follows:

- **Project A:**
  - Probability of success: ($P(\text{Success}) = 0.7$)
  - Cash flow if successful: $20,000
  - Probability of failure: \($P(\text{Failure}) = 0.3$)
  - Cash flow if failed: $5,000

- **Project B:**
  - Probability of success: ($P(\text{Success}) = 0.5$)
  - Cash flow if successful: $25,000
  - Probability of failure: \($P(\text{Failure}) = 0.5$)
  - Cash flow if failed: $8,000

The discount rate is **8%**. Calculate the **Expected NPV** for both projects and compare them.

### **Step 1: Calculate the Expected Cash Flows (ECF)**

The **Expected Cash Flow** (ECF) for each project is calculated by multiplying the probability of each outcome by the corresponding cash flow, then summing the results.

$$
\text{ECF} = P(\text{Success}) \times \text{Cash Flow (Success)} + P(\text{Failure}) \times \text{Cash Flow (Failure)}
$$

#### **Project A:**

$$
\text{ECF}_A = 0.7 \times 20,000 + 0.3 \times 5,000 = 14,000 + 1,500 = 15,500
$$

#### **Project B:**

$$
\text{ECF}_B = 0.5 \times 25,000 + 0.5 \times 8,000 = 12,500 + 4,000 = 16,500
$$

### **Step 2: Calculate the NPV for Each Project**

The **NPV** is the present value of the expected cash flow. Using the formula for NPV:

$$
NPV = \frac{\text{ECF}}{(1 + i)^n}
$$

Where:
- ( $i = 0.08$) (8% discount rate)
- ($n = 1$) (1 year)

#### **Project A:**

$$
NPV_A = \frac{15,500}{(1 + 0.08)^1} = \frac{15,500}{1.08} \approx 14,351.85
$$

#### **Project B:**

$$
NPV_B = \frac{16,500}{(1 + 0.08)^1} = \frac{16,500}{1.08} \approx 15,277.78
$$

### **Step 3: Interpretation**

- **Project A** has an expected NPV of **$14,351.85**.
- **Project B** has an expected NPV of **$15,277.78**.

Although **Project A** has a *higher probability of success*, **Project B** has a higher expected NPV because its cash flows, even with equal probability of success and failure, are more significant.



### **Conclusion:**

Based on the expected NPVs, **Project B** is *probably* a better investment as it provides a higher expected return after factoring in the probabilities of success and failure.

### **9. Cost-Benefit Analysis**

- **Objective:** Evaluate project feasibility by weighing costs against benefits.
- **Steps to Solve:**
    1. Identify all costs and benefits, both tangible and intangible.
    2. Assign monetary values to these where possible.
    3. Calculate Net Present Value (NPV): 
    $$
    NPV=∑\frac{Benefits−Costs}{(1+i)^n}
    $$​
    1. Assess whether NPV > 0.

<span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)"><span style="background:rgba(163, 67, 31, 0.2)"> ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ </span></span>
### **Cost Benefit Analysis Problem**

**Problem:**  
A project has an initial cost of $100,000, generates annual benefits of $30,000, and incurs annual costs of $5,000 for 5 years. Is the project viable if the discount rate is 10%?

**Formula for Net Present Value (NPV):**
$$
NPV = \sum \frac{\text{Benefits} - \text{Costs}}{(1 + i)^n} - \text{Initial Cost}
$$

**Solution:**
$$
NPV = \sum_{n=1}^{5} \frac{30,000 - 5,000}{(1 + 0.10)^n} - 100,000
$$

### **Challenger vs. Defender Problems** 
##### **Key Concepts**

1. **Defender**: The existing asset you currently own and operate.
2. **Challenger**: A potential replacement asset.
3. **Objective**: Minimize the overall cost or maximize the net benefit by comparing the two options over a defined planning horizon.
##### **Steps to Solve Challenger vs. Defender Problems**

###### **1. Gather Data**

- Defender:
    - Current market value (salvage value if sold now).
    - Operating costs and maintenance expenses.
    - Remaining useful life.
    
- Challenger:
    - Initial purchase cost.
    - Expected operating and maintenance costs.
    - Salvage value at the end of its life.
    - Useful life.
###### **2. Calculate Costs for Each Asset**

- **Annual Equivalent Cost (AEC)** is often used to make the comparison, as it normalizes costs over different lifespans.

$$
AEC=\text{Capital Recovery Cost}+\text{Annual Operating Cost}
$$

- **Capital Recovery Cost (CRC)**:

$$
    CRC=\frac{\text{Initial Cost}−\text{Salvage Value}}{(1+i)^n}+(\text{Initial Cost}−\text{Salvage Value})×\frac{i(1+i)^n}{(1+i)^n−1}
    $$
    Where:
    - ($i$): Interest rate.
    - ($n$): Useful life.
    
- Add operating and maintenance costs to CRC to find AEC for both challenger and defender.

<span style="background:rgba(3, 135, 102, 0.2)"><span style="background:rgba(163, 67, 31, 0.2)"> ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ </span></span>
### **Challenger vs. Defender Example**

- **Defender**:
  - Current market value: $5,000
  - Operating cost: $2,000/year
  - Remaining life: 3 years
  - Salvage value in 3 years: $1,000
  
- **Challenger**:
  - Purchase price: $10,000
  - Operating cost: $1,200/year
  - Useful life: 5 years
  - Salvage value in 5 years: $2,000
- **Interest rate ($i$)**: 5% or 0.05


##### **Step 1: Calculate Annual Equivalent Cost (AEC) for the Defender**

###### **Formula for Capital Recovery Cost (CRC)**:
$$
CRC = \frac{\text{Initial Cost} - \text{Salvage Value}}{(1 + i)^n} + (\text{Initial Cost} - \text{Salvage Value}) \cdot \frac{i(1 + i)^n}{(1 + i)^n - 1}
$$

###### **Substitute Values for Defender**:
- Initial Cost = $5,000
- Salvage Value = $1,000
- Remaining Life (\(n\)) = 3 years

$$
CRC = \frac{5000 - 1000}{(1+0.05)^3} + (5000 - 1000) \cdot \frac{0.05(1+0.05)^3}{(1+0.05)^3 - 1}
$$

###### **Add Operating Costs**:
$$
AEC_{\text{Defender}} = CRC + \text{Annual Operating Cost}
$$

$$
AEC_{\text{Defender}} = CRC + 2000
$$


##### **Step 2: Calculate Annual Equivalent Cost (AEC) for the Challenger**

###### **Substitute Values for Challenger**:
- Initial Cost = $10,000
- Salvage Value = $2,000
- Useful Life (\(n\)) = 5 years

$$
CRC = \frac{10000 - 2000}{(1+0.05)^5} + (10000 - 2000) \cdot \frac{0.05(1+0.05)^5}{(1+0.05)^5 - 1}
$$

###### **Add Operating Costs**:
$$
AEC_{\text{Challenger}} = CRC + \text{Annual Operating Cost}
$$

$$
AEC_{\text{Challenger}} = CRC + 1200
$$

##### **Step 3: Compare AEC Values**

- If $(AEC_{\text{Defender}} \leq AEC_{\text{Challenger}}$), keep the defender.
- If ($AEC_{\text{Challenger}} < AEC_{\text{Defender}}$), replace with the challenger.
