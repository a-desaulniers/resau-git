Before we begin!

I would like to give a special thank you to:

- [Guy Kember](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/engineering/math-internetworking/people/people-profiles/guy-kember.html), Professor of Engineering Mathematics at Dalhousie University

-  [Karsten Economou](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4367-2582), Graduate Researcher at the Department of Engineering Mathematics & Internetworking at Dalhousie University
  
- [Hossein Mostafavi Sani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uigiSG8AAAAJ&hl=en), Graduate Mechanical Engineering at Dalhousie University 

For their contributions in Mathematical education, and provision of knowledge for this wiki tree. The following notes are my second year class notes for Applied Differential Equations, and I hope you may find them helpful!

These notes will be updated periodically, and put in order of what I believe to be most helpful.

	- *(if you do not have oscillators, you can just make a regular Yp guess, as was done with first order LTI*
