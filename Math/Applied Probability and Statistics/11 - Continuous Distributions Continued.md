Recall F<sub>x</sub>(x) = 
$$
F_x(X)=1 - e^{-\lambda x^\beta}
$$

- A reminder! The median is the halfway point in a function right? (*so would you agree that's 0.5 probability?*)

>- Now, you have to remember the **bounds** of the function. It's given in each f(x), and is quite important. If it is outside of those bounds, it is **zero**.

### Example 2

- We are told that X is uniformly distributed between 0 & 1. (*note, \[0,1) means 0 is included, but 1 is not*)

Now, for the variance of Y…

Reminder:
- The **expected value of a constant is the constant,** 
- **The variance of a constant is zero**, 
- **Constants can be pulled out from of expected values**
- **Constants can be pulled out of variances, but must be squared**


>[!note] Normal Distribution
>- Most popular distribution due to the <font color="#c0504d">Central Limit Theorem</font>, which states that the sums of random variables tend to a normal distribution.
