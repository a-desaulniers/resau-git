Before we begin!

I would like to give a special thank you to:

- [Gordon Fenton](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/engineering/math-internetworking/people/people-profiles/gordon-fenton.html), Professor of Engineering Mathematics at Dalhousie University

- [Jeremy Balka](https://www.youtube.com/@jbstatistics), Professor of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Guelph
  
- [Zedstatistics](https://www.youtube.com/@zedstatistics), Mathematical Education on YouTube

For their contributions in Mathematical education, and provision of knowledge for this wiki tree. The following notes are my second year class notes for Applied Probability and Statistics, and I hope you may find them helpful!

These notes will be following the units as laid out in *Applied Probability and Statistics, ENGM2032* by G.A Fenton. 

An accompanying [YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMDstUxXg2drwz28nAeSvg_WQztbRKJ9I&feature=shared)series created by G.A Fenton can also be referenced, and used as supplemental information.
