- Need to know mean, and standard deviation

### Example 1

- Step One, **Standardize**

- Now, need to check the [[https://math.arizona.edu/~rsims/ma464/standardnormaltable.pdf|Normal Distribution Table ]]
- Find the Value. The table will tell you everything from the “Left side” to the number you want, and here, we have the right side. 
- So, we need to do 1 — the table value.
- If you get a negative number, just use the equivalent positive number, and use the same process.

Normal Distributions are really helpful, but they are not without faults! 
- There is a very small chance, (about 1/100,000), but we can end up arriving at work before we've even left in the last example.
- It's a very small chance, but still a problem with the normal.

>[!note] Lognormal Distribution
>- If X is lognormally distributed, then $ln_X$ is normally distributed
