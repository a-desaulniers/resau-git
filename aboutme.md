<center><h5>Hello There!</h5></center>

My name is Alexandre DesAulniers, and I'd like to welcome you to my interactive portfolio. 

I am a student at Dalhousie University, enrolled in a bachelors of Electronics Engineering. I run [reseau.cabot.place](https://reseau.cabot.place), am an active member of Dalhousie Student government, maintain one of many side projects, and am a very active member of many communities. You can find a more complete profile on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-desau/details/experience/).

Likewise, I hold interests in many things Electrical Engineers typically do, but also love being outdoors, managing personal investments, playing Ultimate Frisbee, and being an active member of my community.

I am proud of my work on [reseau](https://reseau.cabot.place), and working on completing another #Paper📃 on Canadian Nuclear supply, hopefully wrapping up in early January!

Please reach out at any point
