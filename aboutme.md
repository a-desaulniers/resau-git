<center><h3>Hi There!</h3></center>
<center><h5> My name is Alexandre DesAulniers, and I'd like to welcome you to my portfolio. </h4></center>

I am a student at Dalhousie University, enrolled in a bachelors of Electronics Engineering. I run [reseau.cabot.place](https://reseau.cabot.place), am an active member of Dalhousie Student government, maintain one of many side projects, work with various humanitarian aid groups, and am a very active member of a great number of communities. You can find a more complete profile on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-desau/details/experience/).


Likewise, I hold interests in many things Electrical Engineers typically do, but also love being outdoors, managing personal investments, playing Ultimate Frisbee, and being an active member of my community.


I am proud of my work on [reseau](https://reseau.cabot.place), and I am continuing to work on notes, papers, and other guides.


Please reach out to me at any point at a@desau.ca, and I would be happy to answer any question you may have!

##### Volunteer — Guatemala Engineering Brigades (2025)   
Global Brigades, Inc. Canada 
<font color="#7f7f7f">Nov 2024 - May 2025</font>      
<font color="#7f7f7f">Cruz De Santiago, Chimaltenango, Guatemala · On-site</font>   

- As part of my work with Global Brigades Canada, an engineering design for the layout of a community water system was completed for the community of Cruz De Santiago, Tecpán, Guatemala. Cruz De Santiago is a community lacking resources needed to maintain a reliable water system, supplying water to over 250 homes. Cruz De Santiago also serves as GB's debut engineering relief effort in Guatemala.  
      
    With the help of Civil Engineers from Global Engineering Brigades — Honduras, a design for a redesigned water system was proposed, budgeted presented, and adapted to the needs of the people of Cruz De Santiago, community leaders, and accompanying local community organizations such as COCODE of Tecpán. Garmin GPS mapping and EPANET flow simulation were both heavily used throughout the community to mark entry and exit points, tank location, pressure testing, flow rates, and adaptation of pre-existing infrastructure, along with individual surveying of every home, ensuring the correct community needs were met.
