Before we begin!

I would like to give a special thank you to:

- [Hamed Aly](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/engineering/electrical/faculty-staff/our-faculty/assistant-professors/aly-hamed.html), Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Dalhousie University


For his contributions to mathematics and EM physics education, and provision of knowledge for this wiki tree. The following notes are my ***hand-written*** second year class notes for Electric Circuits I, and I hope you may find them helpful!

These notes will be following the units as laid out in *Electric Circuits, 12th. ed* by James Nilsson, with heavy modification from Dr. H. Aly. 

A note, these notes will be considerably more *raw* than other notes posted on `reseau`, due to the nature of the note-taking. 

An accompanying [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@hamedaly4608/videos)series created by Dr. H. Aly can also be referenced, and used as supplemental information.
