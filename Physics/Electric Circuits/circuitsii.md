The following notes are my ***hand-written*** second year class notes for Electric Circuits II, and I hope you may find them helpful!

These notes will be following *Electric Circuits, 12th. ed* by James Nilsson.

A note, these notes will be considerably more *raw* than other notes posted on `reseau`, due to the nature of the note-taking. 

An accompanying [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@hamedaly4608/videos)lab series created by Dr. H. Aly can also be referenced, and used as supplemental information.
