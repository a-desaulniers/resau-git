Before we begin!

I would like to give a special thank you to:

The following notes are my ***hand-written*** third year class notes for Power Systems I, and I hope you may find them helpful!

These notes will be following *Electrical Power Systems, Revised.* by Mohamed E. El-Hawary.

An accompanying [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@hamedaly4608/videos)lab series created by Dr. H. Aly can also be referenced, under the titles of 'ECED 3001"' and used as supplemental information.
